## Thermo Scientific RadEye code
### This code includes:
- A ROS node that communicates with the RadEye sensors and publishes the radiation readings.
- An application that does the same as above except it logs it to a file, this is not a ROS node.
- An application that will read the log file and print to a screen the output generated from the above code.
- An Arduino sketch that will simulate the output of a RadEye GN+
